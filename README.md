Research Project on Stream Data Classification for IoT devices. Following project applies decision trees with below 1KB RAM requirement to classify data upto 98% accuracy.
We have seen multiple research papers on traditional machine learning and deep learning being applied for human activity recognition, but they all fail to acknowledge the stream data properties and run on IoT systems like microcontrollers.
